### Points of improvement

The first point I'd improve is performance. When the list of Locations/Assets is too long, it can take some time to load.

Points to improve performance:

- Virtualizing the list of assets;
- Caching API requests;
- Debouncing the search input;

Some minor improvements could be made in order to improve UI/UX in general.

Styling:
- Make it more pixel-perfect according to Figma;
- Create more components like Button and Input to be reusable throughout the application;
- Add a loading state when making async requests like changing company or adding/changing filters;
