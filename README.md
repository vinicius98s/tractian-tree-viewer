### Points of improvement

The first point I'd improve would be performance, as when the list of Locations/Assets is too long it takes some time to load.

Points to improve performance:

- Virtualizating the list of assets;
- Caching API requests;
- Debuncing the search input;

There are some minor improvements that could be done in order to improve UI/UX in general.

Styling:

- Make it more pixel perfect according to figma;
- Create more components like Button and Input to be reusable trhough out the application;
- Add a loading state when making async requests like changing company or adding/changing filters;
